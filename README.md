📌 **Featured Projects :**

🔹 **Firmware Update Failure Prediction Tool :**
Designed and implemented a machine-learning–based prediction system using NLP for log feature extraction and an SVM classification model to forecast firmware component update failures. The system analyzes historical SPP update data to identify failure patterns and provides accurate predictions, enabling early detection, proactive mitigation, and improved reliability of firmware update workflows.

🔹 **Libhpsrv Library :**
Contributed to the development of the libhpsrv C++ library, which enables secure communication between host applications and HPE iLO systems. Designed and implemented the VNIC feature, where the virtual NIC is directly connected to the iLO IP, allowing host–iLO communication over the HTTP protocol.

🔹 **DMTF Redfish Implementation:**
Implemented the DMTF Redfish standard in C++, delivering secure RESTful management APIs for HPE servers. Designed, developed, and tested APIs for server monitoring and control, ensuring compliance with Redfish schemas and industry best practices.

🔹 **Raiden Tool Migration (Python 2 → Python 3):**
Led the migration of the Raiden tool from Python 2 to Python 3, modernizing a 100+ file Python codebase by resolving deprecated APIs, updating dependencies, and ensuring compliance with modern Python standards for long-term maintainability.

🔹 **Vendor SPP Automation:**
Developed a Python-based vendor SPP management automation script that streamlined vendor SPP workflows by programmatically cloning new vendor instances upon ProLiant SPP updates and automatically initiating builds for each new release. This solution improved overall process efficiency by 89% compared to previous manual methods.
